ðŸ‘‹ Hello! This is the instruction on how to use/run/test the spring project.

STEPS TO RUN THE PROGRAM
* Clone the repo - git clone https://github.com/chrisfc-dev/tap-code-challenge.git
* Open cmd
* Navigate to the cloned repo
* Execute mvn spring-boot:run

DATA TO PLAY WITH:
{"name":"Tom","ipAddress":"192.168.1.1","environment":"STAGE","appName":"app1"}
{"name":"Jerry","ipAddress":"192.168.1.4","environment":"DEV","appName":"app2"}
{"name":"Khalifa","ipAddress":"192.168.2.10","environment":"PROD","appName":"app2"}
{"name":"Walker","ipAddress":"192.77.2.10","environment":"STAGE","appName":"app1"}
{"name":"Elfie","ipAddress":"192.231.3.41","environment":"DEV","appName":"app2"}

TESTING THE PROGRAM
* Using postman, import the postman collection attached in the email.
  ðŸ“«POSTMAN COLLECTION
  |->Template Request - These are the templates request for the 3 main functionality of the API.
  |->Example Scenario - These are request which show the following scenario:
                        >Adding a client, specific to app and environment
                        >Adding a client, specific to app and environment (Content Negotiation - Accepts JSON/XML and Produce JSON/XML)
                        >Adding a client that is already in the specific app and environment
                        >Adding a client with invalid ip (Accepts only IPV4)
                        >Get list of IP without duplicate
                        >Get list of IP filtered by app name
                        >Get list of IP filtered by environment
                        >Get list of IP filtered by client name
                        >Get list of IP filtered by app name (and/or) environment (and/or) client name
                        >Deleting a client IP specific to app and environment. 
                         Note: IP was not deleted on the main table since, the it has many to many relation to client. :)
                               It will just restrict the client to access the app in specified environment.
  |->Test User - This request is to test if the user can access app in specified environment.


FUNCTIONALITY STATUS:
âœ“ add a client ip (IPv4 only) to the whitelist specific to an environment and app
âœ“ provide the list of ips without duplicates; can filtered by environment, app and/or client name
âœ“ remove a client ip from the list

REQUIREMENTS STATUS:
âœ“ Use java and spring solution.
âœ“ Add a readme file which includes how to run/use/test your app. if your app is able to host or include a generated 'how to use my web service' it would be cool but not required
âœ“ Use file as the persistence db
- Security for the endpoints is not necessary; You can add one if you want.
âœ“ Apply REST best practices in terms of endpoint design, proper status xheaders for the operations, correct use of HTTP Verbs, content negotiation and entity representation. (If I missed something regarding this one, I would really appreciate if you give me feedback. ðŸ‘€ It will be an honor for me to try it myself)
âœ“ support json and xml as content-type

Note: Many apps and environment can be added. I made it like that coz I think it is cool if I want to add a new app for new/existing environment in the future.
I'm sorry if it took a âŒ› while before I submit the GitHub repository. God bless!
